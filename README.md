This is a dummy site to showcase a website for someone with a bunch of products that wants to go straight to the point.

# Easy is the main word of this project

This website is built with Gatsby using CSV files to feed the content.

I choose CSV because it can easily be exported from Excel, an app that is native to business. 

When someone hires me, they send a list of the products and information of each in an Excel or some other spreadsheet. After prepping it, the file is exported to CSV and all the content is up and running on the website.

It is easy, fast and awaiting for clients.
